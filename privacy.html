                  By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                  automatically apply to you ‚Äì you should make sure therefore
                  that you read them carefully before using the app. You‚Äôre not
                  allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                  our trademarks in any way. You‚Äôre not allowed to attempt to
                  extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn‚Äôt try
                  to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
                  versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
                  database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
                  to it, still belong to Chatbot-AI.
                </p> <p>
                  Chatbot-AI is committed to ensuring that the app is
                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                  reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                  its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                  charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                  clear to you exactly what you‚Äôre paying for.
                </p> <p>
                  The Chatbot-AI app stores and processes personal data that
                  you have provided to us, to provide our
                  Service. It‚Äôs your responsibility to keep your phone and
                  access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                  not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                  removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                  official operating system of your device. It could make your
                  phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                  compromise your phone‚Äôs security features and it could mean
                  that the Chatbot-AI app won‚Äôt work properly or at all.

                    The app does use third-party services that declare their
                    Terms and Conditions.

                  You should be aware that there are certain things that
                  Chatbot-AI will not take responsibility for. Certain
                  functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
                  by your mobile network provider, but Chatbot-AI
                  cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                  functionality if you don‚Äôt have access to Wi-Fi, and you don‚Äôt
                  have any of your data allowance left.
                </p> <p></p> <p>
                  If you‚Äôre using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                  should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                  the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                  other third-party charges. In using the app, you‚Äôre accepting
                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                  charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you‚Äôre
                  using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                  received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                </p> <p>
                  Along the same lines, Chatbot-AI cannot always take
                  responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                  make sure that your device stays charged ‚Äì if it runs out of
                  battery and you can‚Äôt turn it on to avail the Service,
                  Chatbot-AI cannot accept responsibility.
                </p> <p>
                  With respect to Chatbot-AI‚Äôs responsibility for your
                  use of the app, when you‚Äôre using the app, it‚Äôs important to
                  bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                  to you. Chatbot-AI accepts no liability for any
                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                  relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                </p> <p>
                  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                  currently available on Android &amp; iOS ‚Äì the requirements for the 
                  both systems(and for any additional systems we
                  decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                  and you‚Äôll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                  using the app. Chatbot-AI does not promise that it
